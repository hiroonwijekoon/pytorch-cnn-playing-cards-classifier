## Introduction

In this project, we develop a CNN-based model to classify playing cards into different categories. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of images of playing cards from various decks and suits. The goal is to accurately identify the type of playing card depicted in a given image.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used for training and evaluation contains a diverse collection of playing card images. It includes images of cards from different decks, suits, and ranks. The dataset is preprocessed to ensure consistency in image size and format.

- Dataset Size: 7794 images
- Classes: 53 (One class for each type of playing card)
- Image Size: 224 x 224 pixels (RGB format)
- Train-Validation-Test Split: 7624 images / 265 images / 265 images

## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of a series of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. Here's an overview of the model architecture:

For more details, refer to the [Model Architecture](#model-architecture) section in the code.

## Training Process

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with the Cross-Entropy Loss function. Training is performed over multiple epochs, with early stopping implemented to prevent overfitting. Training progress and performance metrics are monitored using validation data.

For detailed information about the training process, refer to the [Training Process](#training-process) section in the code.

## Model Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance. The evaluation includes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, qualitative assessment is performed by visualizing predictions on sample test images.

For more details, refer to the [Model Evaluation](#model-evaluation) section in the code.
